# TheLonelyTree

The game is less of a game and more of a "experience". I don't plan to add any gameplay mechanics. The game will allow you to write and add diary entries, though less diary and more "important events" that occur throughout your life. While you add these, each entry becomes a node on a tree as it slowly grows up in a line. When your entry title ever matches to someone elses entry title, some of their tree will start to grow and branch off of yours. As you add more and more to your tree, you can read and connect with all the other anonymous people whom had similar experiences. You start of as a tiny sapling on a hill in a vast meadow, and eventually growing into a massive tree, alone in the meadow but connected to all.
